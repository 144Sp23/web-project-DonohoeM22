                <h2>Knitting For Beginners!</h2>
                
                <p>New to Knitting? No problem! To start, you'll need a ball of yarn, a pair of knitting needles, and a pattern.</p>
                
                <h4>How to Cast On</h4>
                <p>Once you have your materials and a pattern picked out, we'll cast on. This is done by first making a slipnot and sliding it onto the right needle. Next, hold the yard in your left hand, and split the strands with your index finger and thumb, creating a loop. Next, you'll slide each loop onto the needle and tighten them so they fit snugly on the needle. Here, the yarn should just barely be able to slide up and down the needle. Cast on complete!</p>
                
                <h4>Your First Stitches</h4>
                <p>To create your first stitch, hold the cast-on needle in your left hand. Slide the empty needle into the first stitch of the cast-on. Next, wrap the yarn around the right needle counterclockwise, creating a loop. Slip the needle through the loop. Next, slide the needle upwards and to the right to slide the stitch off the needle, creating the first stitch! Repeat and enjoy your new hobby!</p>
